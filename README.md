# 2D-game-java
### *WORK IN PROGRESS*
This is really just a project I used to learn and apply knowledge gained from early college classes. I followed a YouTube tutorial for this and all assets were made by me. 

There is no executable file for this project, but I did attach a .jar file if you can manage to get that to work. Otherwise, all the source code is there, so it should work in any IDE using Java (I use Eclipse).

Thanks for checking this out!
